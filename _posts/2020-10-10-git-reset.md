I am back again to talk about git, this time I wanted to focus on `git reset`
and what the various options `--soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard` are and the
different ways you can use the command. I want to talk about `git reset` because
to understand the various ways you can use the command you really need to
understand the life cycle of files when working with git. That means I would
also need to explain the various stages you can think of a file as being in and
I love explaining shit.

Any time I have a chance to build a slightly better mental model of git I'm
going to take it because understanding something as fundamental as the flow of a
file from untracked to committed _really_ fucking helps in the long run.

## high level

To start I spent weeks designing and drawing the following diagram (you're
welcome) to show there are three places you can think of a file as being: in the
working tree, in the index, or committed. The arrows show the various ways you
can move a file between these stages using git commands. Spoiler: you can use
`git reset` for some of these movements.

I'll go over each of these stages but if you want a much deeper insight
into what git is doing have a read of a post I wrote a while ago called [How Git
Works]({% post_url 2020-07-19-how-git-works %}), that post gets very low level
if that's your sort of thing.

For this post however I'll keep it as high level as I can, let's start from the
working tree.

### the working tree

The working tree as it's known in git is really just your working directory,
it's all the files you can currently see in your directory. More specifically
it's everything in the directory that isn't the `.git` directory.

```
> git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/skip/.git/
> echo state A > file
> ls -Al
total 8
-rw-r----- 1 skip skip    3 Oct 11 11:14 file        # <- in working tree
drwxr-x--- 5 skip skip 4096 Oct 11 11:13 .git        # <- not in working tree
```

`git status` shows you the relationships between the working tree, the index,
and committed stages. In other words how do the references to files in these
areas differ? Running it now will show us the path for any files in the
working tree that aren't tracked by git, we should expect `file` to show up
here.

```
> git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        file

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

What `git status` is showing us here is what we _could_ commit if we added this
file with `git add`.

This is really simple so I won't dwell on it, working tree equals files that
don't live in `.git` that you can edit/delete/modify. Let's check out the next
stage, the index.

### index

If we look inside the `.git` folder we should see a bunch of stuff that is
needed by git. An important one here is the `HEAD` file which just contains the
hash of the commit that our branch is currently pointing to. Right now it's
empty. We'll be changing `HEAD` pretty extensively later using `git reset`.

```
> ls -Al .git
total 20
-rw-r----- 1 skip skip   92 Oct 11 11:13 config
-rw-r----- 1 skip skip   23 Oct 11 11:13 HEAD     # <- tip of current branch
drwxr-x--- 2 skip skip 4096 Oct 11 11:13 hooks
drwxr-x--- 4 skip skip 4096 Oct 11 11:13 objects
drwxr-x--- 4 skip skip 4096 Oct 11 11:13 refs
```

Let's use `git add` to _stage_ `file` and have another look inside `.git`.

```
> git add file
> ls -Al .git
total 24
-rw-r----- 1 skip skip   92 Oct 11 11:13 config
-rw-r----- 1 skip skip   23 Oct 11 11:13 HEAD
drwxr-x--- 2 skip skip 4096 Oct 11 11:13 hooks
-rw-r----- 1 skip skip  104 Oct 11 11:16 index     # <- welcome to the party!
drwxr-x--- 5 skip skip 4096 Oct 11 11:16 objects
drwxr-x--- 4 skip skip 4096 Oct 11 11:13 refs
```

There is a new file called `index` and this is the file that holds information
on tracked content, it is a view of what _would_ be committed if you were to use
`git commit` right this second. This file is also known as the cache, the
staging area, or staging.

The index is a binary file so we can't just open it up and look at it as you
might probably want to do, you could use `xxd` to view a hex dump if you want...

```
> xxd .git/index
00000000: 4449 5243 0000 0002 0000 0001 5f82 dc32  DIRC........_..2
00000010: 2fdc 47da 5f82 dc32 2fdc 47da 0000 fe01  /.G._..2/.G.....
00000020: 0013 fca4 0000 81a4 0000 03e8 0000 03e8  ................
00000030: 0000 0008 5165 4802 d7a7 590f 1744 b7a6  ....QeH...Y..D..

00000060: 1e8c 569c e3c3 8970                      ..V....p
```

... but I'm just going to use the git plumbing command
[ls-files](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-files) to peak inside the index file
and get human readable output, we can see staged content by passing the `--stage` option.

```
> git ls-files --stage -v
H 100644 51654802d7a7590f1744b7a6f6661f5fcf678799 0     file
```

When we ran `git add` in the previous section git took the content of `file`
and created a blob for it, saved it in `.git/objects/` then updated the index
with a reference to it.

Breaking apart the line we got back from `ls-files` we have an `H` at the start
of the line which means "cached", the different values you can have here are:

* `H` - cached
* `S` - skip-worktree
* `M` - unmerged
* `R` - removed/deleted
* `C` - modified/changed
* `K` - to be killed
* `?` - other

Next we have `100644` which are the file permissions.

Then `516548...` which is the SHA-1 hash value of the `file` contents.

After that is `0` which is the stage number, this value is only really needed
when handling merge conflicts, the different values you can have are:

* `0` - "normal", un-conflicted, all-is-well.
* `1` - "base", the common ancestor version.
* `2` - "ours", the target (HEAD) version.
* `3` - "theirs", the being-merged-in version.

And finally there is the name of the file: `file`.

So that's what is inside the `index` file right now, the version of `file` in
our working tree is the same as the version that's in our index. If we consider
`file` to be in state `A` then our high level overview diagram will look like
this.

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-a.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state A" />

As I mentioned before `git status` can show us the difference between these
three stages, right now the working tree and the index version are the same:
`A`. There is no version of this file currently committed.

Running `git status` now means git will see there is something in the index that
isn't committed so we get a `"Changes to be committed"` message.

```
> git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   file

```

I think it's time we moved to the next stage and commit this bad boy.

## committed

We have our staged file, all we need to do now is run `git commit`.

```
> git commit -m "commit A"
[master (root-commit) 4534c70] commit A
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 file
```

What happened here is git takes the contents of the index file and uses that as
the basis for a new _tree object_ and creates a commit object with that and the
message I've passed in. `HEAD` now points to `4534c70`.

This means `HEAD` is now pointing at the commit that contains `file`.

```text
> git --no-pager show HEAD
```

```
commit 4534c709ed7a96cdbd768cc913333308dbc448f7 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Skip Gibson <skip@skipgibson.dev>
Date:   Sun Oct 11 11:21:12 2020 +0100

    commit A

diff --git a/file b/file
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..5165480
--- /dev/null
+++ b/file
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+state A
```

What I've been calling the `committed` stage in reality is the commit
object that's currently being pointed to by `HEAD`. So our overview diagram now
looks like this:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-a-all.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state A" />

You might think our staging area (the index file) is empty seeing as we've
committed our changes but that's not true, using `ls-files` again we can see it
still holds a reference to `file`.

```
> git ls-files --stage -v
H 100644 51654802d7a7590f1744b7a6f6661f5fcf678799 0     file
```

Knowing the index file is never really empty is important because it's how `git
status` is able to do what it does. Running `git status` will show "nothing to
commit" because:

* There are no untracked files.
* The working tree and the index currently show `file` in state `A`.
* The index and the commit `HEAD` points to show `file` in state `A`.

```
> git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## state B

We've had a whistle stop tour through the three stages using a new file as our
vehicle but let's modify `file` and see what git does.

```
> echo state B > file
> git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   file

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

If we consider the state of `file` in our working tree as state `B`
then this is our new high level view:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-b.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state B" />

`git status` sees there is a difference between the working tree and the index
so it shows us a message telling us `file` is modified.

Adding this file will update the index.

```
> git add file
> git ls-files --stage -v
H 100644 793840a1ed84ee1ec84a7db7b733f97c532d14c9 0     file
```

Notice the cached version of `file` in the index is different from before, the
hash has changed. `git status` will now show us that `file` is staged for commit
because although the working tree and the index now reference `file` in state
`B` the commit that `HEAD` is pointing to references the file in state `A`.

```
> git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   file

```

Our high level overview now looks like this:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-b-staged.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state B" />

And of course running `git commit` will use whatever is in the index file right
now to create a new commit object...

```
> git commit -m "commit B"
[master 8f2b4d2] commit B
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

...`git status` will show everything is up to date...

```
> git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

...and our overview now shows that state `B` is what is seen in all three
stages.

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-b-all.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state B" />

Up until now we've been moving through these stages in one direction, from
left to right, but what do you do if you want to go the other way? What if you
want your committed stage to see `file` in state `A` but you want the index and
your working tree to see state `B`?

To answer these sorts of questions we can finally move onto talking about `git reset`!

## git reset

`git reset`, according to its man page, can be used in these three ways:

```
git reset [-q] [<tree-ish>] [--] <paths>...
git reset (--patch | -p) [<tree-ish>] [--] [<paths>...]
git reset [--soft | --mixed [-N] | --hard | --merge | --keep] [-q] [<commit>]
```

I'll go over these three uses in order.

### git reset paths...

```
git reset [-q] [<tree-ish>] [--] <paths>...
```
In this form of the command git will reset the index entries for `<paths>...` to
whatever is in the `<tree-ish>` object. It does _not_ affect the working tree or
the current branch (the committed stage in our examples).

Before I get stuck into an example here I should mention that `<tree-ish>` means
the command can take either a tree object, a commit object, or a tag object.
Ultimately the command wants to operate on a tree but it'll de-reference a
commit or a tag if one is passed in to get the underlying tree object.

The brackets `[]` just mean the option or argument is optional so in this
instance we can just pass a path to a file and it'll do _something_. If we don't
pass a `<tree-ish>` object then the command defaults to `HEAD`.

As always an example helps a lot so let's set up the repo to look like this:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-c-staged.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state C" />

To do that I'll just edit our `file` and add it to the index.

```
> echo state C > file
> git add file
> git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   file

```

As I mentioned `git reset [<tree-ish>] <path>` will reset the reference of `<path>` in our
index to reflect whatever tree we pass in or by default whatever commit `HEAD` points to.

That means running `git reset file` right now will update index to reference the
same `file` state that `HEAD` is pointing to, which is state `B`.

```
> git reset file
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       file
> git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   file

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

This leaves our overview looking like this:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-c.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state C" />

If we instead pass a reference to `commit A` to the command then it will update
the index with state `A` for `file` while the working tree references state `C` and
`HEAD` references state `B`.

```
> git --no-pager log --oneline
8f2b4d2 (HEAD -> master) commit B
4534c70 commit A
> git reset 4534c70 file
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       file
```

If everything has gone to plan then the working tree, the index, and `HEAD`
should all hold references to different states for `file`. That means running
`git status` now will show that we have changes not yet staged for commit as
well as staged changes ready for commit for the same file.

```
> git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   file

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   file

```

And just to prove `HEAD` hasn't been moved let's see what commit it's pointing
at.

```
> git rev-parse HEAD
8f2b4d20ab48c5887cfc251a920ae9b599313c3c # <- hash for commit B
```

Our overview now looks like this:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-cab.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state C" />

In essence `git reset <paths>...` is how you remove a file from the staging
area, that's pretty much the only way I use the command in this form. You can
think of it as the opposite of `git add`.

Actually, the current state of the repo is great as it lets me quickly go over
the second way you can use `git reset` and that's using the `--patch` option.

## git reset --patch

```
git reset (--patch | -p) [<tree-ish>] [--] [<paths>...]
```

A few of the git commands take a `--patch` option, for example `git add` which I
wrote [a short post on a while ago]({% post_url
2020-02-19-git-add-patch %}). Like `git add` the `-p` option allows you to
interactively select hunks from files that you want to update in your index
file, AKA unstage those changes.

This is exactly the same as the previous way to use the command except it's
interactive and you don't have to specify `<paths>...` either. Without a tree or
a path the command will ask you for each hunk in the index if you want to reset
it to what `HEAD` can see for the file.

Remember that the index is currently holding a reference to `file` in state `A`
and `HEAD` is pointing at `commit B`, the following should bring the index back
inline with `HEAD`.

```
> git reset -p
```

```
diff --git a/file b/file
index 793840a..5165480 100644
--- a/file
+++ b/file
@@ -1 +1 @@
-state B
+state A
Unstage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,e,?]? y
```

```
> git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   file

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
> cat file
state C
```

This has left our overview looking like this again:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-c.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state C" />

That's all I want to say about `--patch` so let's tackle the last way you can
use `git reset`.

## git reset --mode

```
git reset [<mode>] [<commit>]
```

This way of using the command will require a little more explanation that the
other two ways we just went over, and that's because this version will update
`HEAD` to point to whatever `<commit>` you pass in. If you don't pass a
`<commit>` then the commit that `HEAD` is pointing to is used.

On top of the whole commit malarkey you can pass a `<mode>` option, and you get
to choose from these:

* --soft
* --mixed
* --hard
* --merge
* --keep

If you don't choose a mode then `--mixed` is the default.

Now I'll be honest I had no idea `--merge` and `--keep` existed until I read the
man page for `git-reset` for this post. I am going to explain the fuck out of
the first three but I'll leave the last two for you to read up on by yourself.

The thing to keep in mind when resetting to a commit is that `HEAD` is _always_
moved, you specify a mode to determine what happens with the index and the
working tree.

### --soft

```
git reset --soft [<commit>]
```

The soft mode allows you to update the commit that `HEAD` points to while
leaving the index and the working tree completely untouched.

To demonstrate let's say the repo is at `commit B` and the working tree, the
index, and `HEAD` all see `file` in state `B`.

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-b-all.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state B" />

Running `git reset --soft 4534c70` to reset `HEAD` to point at `commit A` should
result in this view of the world.

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-bba.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state B B A" />

```
> git reset --soft 4534c70
> git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   file

> cat file
state B
```

As expected `git status` is saying we have staged commits because our working
tree and index see `file` in state `B` whereas `HEAD` is pointing at `commit A`
and sees the file in state `A`. And this is what `HEAD` is pointing to:

```
> git --no-pager log --oneline
4534c70 (HEAD -> master) commit A
```

Here is a wee tip for you, when you run a command in git that moves `HEAD` git
will create `ORIG_HEAD` that points to the commit that `HEAD` was pointing to before
you did the action.

That means we can move `HEAD` back to `commit B` by running `git reset
ORIG_HEAD`.

```
> git reset ORIG_HEAD
> git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Seeing as all of our stages are now referencing the file in state `B` then
there's nothing for `git status` to report.

### --mixed

```
git reset --mixed [<commit>]
```

This option is the default mode that's used if you don't pass a mode option,
so all of these versions do the same thing:

* `git reset`
* `git reset HEAD`
* `git reset --mixed`
* `git reset --mixed HEAD`

Like `--soft` this command will update `HEAD` to point at `<commit>` except this
time the index is updated to reflect `<commit>` and the working tree is left
untouched.

As a reminder here is our view of the world as it stands right now:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-b-all.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state B" />

Running `git reset --mixed 4534c70` to point `HEAD` at `commit A` should also
update the index.

```
> git reset --mixed 4534c70
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       file
> git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   file

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

`git status` confirms that index was indeed updated to reflect `commit A` and
shows that we have a modified file in our working tree because our working tree
is showing `file` in state `B`.

This is our view of the world now:

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-b.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state B" />

Let's reset using `git reset ORIG_HEAD` and have a look at the next option.

## --hard

```
git reset --hard [<commit>]
```

If `--soft` left the index and the working tree alone, and `--mixed` updated the
index and left the working tree alone, then it makes sense that `--hard` would
be the option that updates _everything_.

Running this command will reset all of our stages to reflect `<commit>`.

Currently every stage sees `file` in state `B`

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-b-all.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state B" />

Let's reset every stage to `commit A` which has `file` in state `A`.

```
> git reset --hard 4534c70
HEAD is now at 4534c70 commit A
> git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

`git status` is reporting no changes because our working tree, our index, and
`HEAD` are all seeing `file` in state `A`.

<img src="/assets/img/2020-10-10/state-a-all.png" class="blog-image" alt="A
simplified overview the file life cycle in git - state A" />

This mode is very handy if you need to completely blow away a bunch of commits
and you don't care about the changes those commits had made.

## fin

Well shit is that it? No of course not there's plenty more in the `git-reset`
man page for you to read! Everything I've just explained should cover 99%
of the things you will ever want to do with `git reset`, at least now we
understand what the hell is going on.

Go read the docs for [git reset](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-reset) and
don't be scared. I believe in you.
